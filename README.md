#Game of Life

This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) as an Android app. It works pretty well, has a holo themed UI, tap a cell on the screen to fill it, a slider to control animation speed, a button to stop and start the animation, and a menu where you can play around with the rules of life that control when a cell lives or dies. Works best on tablets or other devices with large screens as I never got around to using fragments or optimizing the UI for phone sized screens.
